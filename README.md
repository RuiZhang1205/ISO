As a newly proposed swarm intelligence algorithm, the sheep optimizationalgorithm (SO) has achieved definite achievement by imitating three types of behaviors of the sheep, namely the bellwether guidance (BGD), the sheep
interaction (SIA), and the shepherd dog supervision (SDS) respectively. To enhance the performance, we further design an improved sheep optimization algorithm (ISO) based on the characteristic of the three strategies. Specifi-
cally, the gradient descent strategy (GDS) is proposed to accelerate the convergence speed of the BGD process. As for the SIA procedure, a dimension by dimension improvement (DDI) technique is used to seek a wider region of
the solution space. Moreover, in the SDS stage, an effective variable neighborhood search (VNS) is adopted to balance exploration and exploitations The experimental results demonstrate that ISO outperforms other compared state-
of-the-art algorithms in terms of the quality of the solution, the convergence speed, and the solution stability. Finally, ISO further demonstrates its efficacy and flexibility through solving three real-world engineering problems.
